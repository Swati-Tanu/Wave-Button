# Wave Button

### The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic animation using CSS.

This project is a static page with an animation in it built using only CSS.

### Perfect little animation:

* Simple CSS projects with source code.
* CSS animation for beginners.
* Getting introduced to some underrated and quite useful tags.

## Getting Started
#### Since this is an example project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own purposes. It's a good starter boilerplate.

* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to view the website.
* Explore the code by opening the file in a text editor and following the comments.
